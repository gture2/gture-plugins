# Provider: GitHub

Use this provider when `git remote get-url origin` contains `github.com`.

## How This Fits with the Rest of the Plugin

- **Reading** — Use `gh` to fetch PR/issue metadata, comments, linked issues, and commit messages.
- **Posting** — Use `gh pr comment` or `gh issue comment` to post the test execution report and any interim notices (no URL found, auto-generated plan).

GitHub does not support file attachments on issue/PR comments, so screenshots are described inline as "Screenshot captured at point of failure" rather than embedded as files.

## Prerequisites

The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated. Verify with:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, run `gh auth login` or set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

### Token Permissions

| Permission | Access | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| **Metadata** | Read | Resolve repository owner and name |
| **Issues** | Read & Write | Fetch issue body and comments; post result comment |
| **Pull requests** | Read & Write | Fetch PR body, commits, and comments; post result comment |

---

## Resolving Owner and Repo

```bash
REMOTE=$(git remote get-url origin)
OWNER=$(echo "$REMOTE" | sed 's|https://github.com/||;s|git@github.com:||' | cut -d'/' -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE"  | sed 's|https://github.com/||;s|git@github.com:||' | cut -d'/' -f2 | sed 's|\.git$||')
```

---

## Fetching PR Content

```bash
gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json number,title,body,state,headRefName,baseRefName,url,author,labels,commits,closingIssuesReferences,comments
```

Fetching comments separately if needed:
```bash
gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments" \
  --jq '.[].body'
```

Linked issues:
```bash
gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'
```

---

## Fetching Issue Content

```bash
gh issue view ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --json number,title,body,state,labels,assignees,comments,projectItems
```

Linked PRs from an issue:
```bash
gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/issues/${ISSUE_NUMBER}/timeline" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.event=="cross-referenced" or .event=="closed") | .source.issue.number // empty'

gh pr list --search "${ISSUE_NUMBER} in:body" --state all \
  --json number,title,state,headRefName,url,body --limit 20
```

## Posting the "Test in Progress" Comment

Post a single starting comment on the entry artefact immediately after platform detection so the author knows the web app test run has started and that it can take several minutes (Playwright install + browser session) to complete.

**PR:**
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
🤖 **Web app test in progress**

I'm installing Playwright if needed, launching a browser session, and executing the test plan against the deployed app. The full test execution report will be posted as a comment when complete — this may take a few minutes.
EOF
)"
```

**Issue:**
```bash
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
🤖 **Web app test in progress**

I'm installing Playwright if needed, launching a browser session, and executing the test plan against the deployed app. The full test execution report will be posted as a comment when complete — this may take a few minutes.
EOF
)"
```

If posting fails, output a single warning line and continue — do not stop the run.

## Posting the "No URL Found" Comment

**PR:**
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body "🤖 web-app-tester could not run — no testable URL was found.
Add a comment with the URL (e.g. Preview URL: https://...) and re-trigger."
```

**Issue:**
```bash
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --body "🤖 web-app-tester could not run — no testable URL was found.
Add a comment with the URL (e.g. Preview URL: https://...) and re-trigger."
```

---

## Posting the Auto-Generated Plan Comment

**PR:**
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
🤖 web-app-tester — No test plan found. Auto-generated plan, executing now:

${AUTO_GENERATED_STEPS}
EOF
)"
```

**Issue:**
```bash
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
🤖 web-app-tester — No test plan found. Auto-generated plan, executing now:

${AUTO_GENERATED_STEPS}
EOF
)"
```

---

## Posting the Test Execution Report

Construct the full report body following `styles/report-template.md`, then post it.

**PR:**
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
${REPORT_BODY}
EOF
)"
```

**Issue:**
```bash
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
${REPORT_BODY}
EOF
)"
```

---

## Output

On completion:
```
web-app-tester complete for {ENTRY_TYPE} #{ENTRY_ID}: {OVERALL_RESULT} — {PASSED}/{TOTAL} steps passed
```
